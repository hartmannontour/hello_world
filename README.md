How to use command line to manage GitHub on Mac

Some general command line commands:
- cd ==> change directory
- ls ==> list of all the files in your directory

The five main GitHub commandline commands:
- git clone ==> this will create/clone your GitHub project (i.e. git clone https://github.com/whateverisyourname.git)
- git status ==> this is comparing the local version to the official online repository
- git add filename.extension (e.g. index.html) ==> this will add your file locally
- git commit - m "your message" (e.g. "added index.html) ==> you is commiting/saving the change locally
- git push ==> this will push the update to GitHub.com
- git pull ==> this is retrieving the latest version from GitHub.com

- git ==> will show all the commands you can use in the commandline program.
